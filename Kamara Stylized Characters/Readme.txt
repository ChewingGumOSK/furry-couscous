1. Copy of assetstore info

A wonderfully flexible overall character solution with modular characters, multiple cloth material variants, skin tone and hair options, Mecanim humanoid and generic animations, third person controller, AI wanderer script, headtrack system and lots of prefabs which will work right after your drag them into your scene. 

This collection contains 8 character models with 13 hair models fit for each one of them. For each body model there are 2 different cloth texture presets and 3 skin tone options. The package also includes 7 different eye color variants. These interchangeable parts of the characters can be used to create 4700+ different combinations, which means that these characters can very well be used as a full character solution for your stylized/cartoon style projects. 

Triangles per character average approximately to 6700, the exact polygon count depends on the meshes selected for usage. Although optimized for PC projects the polygon count is low enough to be viable for mobile developers. 

The albedo and normal texture maps included come mainly in high 2048x2048 resolution (with the exception of eye textures being 1024x1024). 

We have also included 3 lightweight scripts usable with these characters. The scripts are: a third person controller, an artificial intelligence wanderer and a standalone headtracker. Bound to prefabs, the scripts enable you to just drag and drop AI characters and PC controllers to your project and test play without any additional setup required. 

The animations of our character solution come in both Mecanim humanoid versions and as generic type animations for greater compatibility. We have included ready to use prefabs with both animation versions. In addition to our animations, the Mecanim system also allows the use of humanoid animations made by other publishers. 

The 31 animations include: IdleA, IdleB, IdleC, Walk, WalkBackwards, Run, Jump, RunningJump, TurnOnSpotLeft, TurnOnSpotRight, Sit, TalkA, TalkB, TalkC, Clap, Dance, Faint, LaughA, LaughB, LaughC, LyingDown, NoGesture, PickUpItem, PointFinger, PressButton, Throw, ThumbUp, Wonder, Yawn, YesGesture, Wave.


2. Using prefabs

Prefab files come with basic character scripts for testing purposes and have materials placed on their meshes. To try out a prefab just pull it into your scene view and press play.

You can change the active meshes and textures in prefabs for great variance in character presets.


3. Using FBX files

Plain FBX files do not have materials placed on their meshes. This is because there are multiple variants for each mesh to choose from. To view an FBX file with textures choose a material for it from the texture folder's subfolders titled: Materials.


4. About KamaraBasicHeadTrack.cs

To use this script you have to have character's avatar type set to humanoid.


5. About KamaraBasicPlayerController.cs

A WASD-controller with jump and run features bound to space and left shift.


6. About KamaraBasicWandererAI.cs

This AI system is raycast based and therefore works independent of navigation meshes.
	

7. Using third party animations
